## About Me

I have studied programming since primary school (Basic, Pascal, Delphi). I got my first job as a Software Engineer after my graduation in 2011. I have developed and supported some Lotus Notes applications in my first year. I have become web developer after that. I didn't finish any courses I learned all by myself. We have used PHP for backend and HTML, CSS, jQuery for frontend at the begining.

## Code Example

[Isograms KATA from CODEWARS](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ba84be607a92aa900000f1): An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

```
function isIsogram(str){
  return str == '' || !str.toLowerCase().split('').some(function(v,i,a){
    return a.lastIndexOf(v)!=i;
